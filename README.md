**Important Note**

To work with this file please download it and use it locally in a folder with the dataset from kaggle, it will automatically create 489 intermediate csv files and a final csv file with the pandas dataframe that is more easily loadable. Make sure you work in a folder because it *will* get cluttered very quickly. The files were too big to push to the repository.
